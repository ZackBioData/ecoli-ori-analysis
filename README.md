# ecoli-ori-analysis
In this project, I analyzed the E. coli genome to identify the Origin of Replication (ORI)â€”the region where DNA replication begins. Using k-mer frequency analysis and clump detection, I searched for DNA sequences that appear frequently within specific genome regions, a key characteristic of ORI sites.
